This causes issues when sending the data from the FiveM server to the clients (ie. Having to wait for previous packets to have been sent before sending more). \n\n~~So, moving to WebRTC (which is built on top of UDP) might increase the performance by a lot.~~\n\nI might be able to move the connection onto the server and implement a PHP client that accepts UDP data from the resource running on FiveM.","files":null}]}
