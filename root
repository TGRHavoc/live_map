It also spews out a \"too many files open\" message which, leads me to think that the sockets aren't being closed properly. I can't seem to reliably reproduce this behaviour either (I've tried DoS-ing the socket server but, it looks good).\n\nSo, I can either cap the number of people who can connect to the interface (configurable, obviously) or I can try and pin-point how/when/why they aren't being closed.","files":null}]}
