The only potential solution I've seen is to install the dependencies manually and modify the __resource.lua file.\n\n1. Make sure NodeJS and NPM are installed for your distro \n2. Navigate to the resource's location \n3. Run `npm install`\n4. Remove `dependency \"yarn\"` from the resource file\n5. Try starting again\n\nIf this doesn't fix the issue then, I believe the only thing you can do is build the server yourself with support... Not exactly sure how you would do that but, apparently others have been.","files":null},{"type":4,"author":{"id":"be8e7c700adc45bcaca3ede23fdcebb01b1496f2"},"timestamp":1560766365,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDExOkNsb3NlZEV2ZW50MjQxNzEwNTcwNw=="},"status":2}]}
