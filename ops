We don't send any data back from the client so, SSE is looking more promising.\n\nPlus, if we start to use SSE's we can take advantage of FiveM's reverse proxy and move their installations to Ssl-enabled websites.\n\n Obviously this would need a re-write of the interface.\nIt wouldn't be breaking on the resource side (no changes to the API) . Maybe would on the interface)(as we're scrapping websockets all together which, might be relied on by custom scripts).","files":null}]}
