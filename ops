Then, tried to do it with Lua but... No success. \nMy attempt is over at https://github.com/TGRHavoc/live_map/tree/failed/sse and **doesn't work**. It's just there to show that I am actively working on trying to find a solution.\n\nI've tried to explain to the best of my ability what I think is wrong in commit 735df7b95d60a4ef69ba730d4f9ef8614ac01303.\n\nIn the mean time, I will look at re-writing the resource in C#. More specifically, dotnet. Hopefully I can get something working kind of like webadmin. Afaik, this resource does SSE successfully with an `/events` endpoint.\n\nSo, more research is required and, possibly, a rewrite is needed.\n\nNote: The server-side events and stuff will all still be the same. This will not be a \"breaking\" change to others depending on the resource. It will however, need another version of the interface to work... Which, I will try and do as simply as possible. Hopefully it's just a matter of swicthing from Websockets to the EventSource API.\nGod, I hope it's that simple.","files":null}]}
